# Installing Docker on an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance

This guide will walk you through the steps to install Docker on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

- An Amazon Linux EC2 instance
- SSH access to the instance

## Steps

### 🔖Step 1: Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.

```
 ssh -i copykeypair.pem ec2-user@<EC2-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>
```

### 💻Step 2: Run the following command to update the package index:

```sh
sudo yum update -y
```

### 👩‍💻Step 3: Once the update is complete, run the following command to install Docker:

```sh
sudo yum install -y docker
```

### 🔦 Step 4: After the installation is complete, start the Docker service using the following command:

```sh
sudo service docker start
```


### ✌️Step 5: To verify that Docker is installed correctly, run the following command to check the version:

```sh
sudo docker --version
```

This should install Docker on your EC2 instance and allow you to start using it.

You can also use the below commands to check if the docker is in active status or not on your machine:

```sh
sudo systemctl is-active docker
```

To get info about the docker:


```sh
sudo docker info
```
