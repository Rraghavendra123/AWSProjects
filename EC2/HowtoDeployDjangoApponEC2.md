# Deploying a Django Application on EC2, Dockerizing, and Configuring Jenkins 

In this tutorial, we'll go through the process of deploying a Django application on an EC2 instance, Dockerizing it, and configuring Jenkins to automate the deployment process.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- An EC2 instance running with SSH access
- Docker and Jenkins installed on the EC2 instance
- A Django application ready for deployment

## Deploying a Django Application on EC2

To deploy your Django application on the EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. Copy your application files to the EC2 instance using SCP or any other file transfer method.
2. SSH into the EC2 instance and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment for the project and activate it.
4. Install the project dependencies using pip.
5. Run the Django development server to make sure the application is working properly.

## Dockerizing the Django Application

To Dockerize your Django application on the EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. Create a Dockerfile in the project directory.
2. Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and tag it with a name.
3. Run the Docker container on the EC2 instance and map the container port to the host port.

## Configuring Jenkins to Run the Django Application

To configure Jenkins to automate the deployment process of your Django application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Jenkins job.
2. Configure the job to pull the code from your Git repository.
3. Add build steps to build the Docker image and run the container on the EC2 instance.
4. Configure post-build actions to transfer the application files to the EC2 instance using SSH.

ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ That's it! With these steps, you can deploy your Django application on an EC2 instance, Dockerize it, and configure Jenkins to automate the deployment process.
